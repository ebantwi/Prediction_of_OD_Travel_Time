  """
  Calculate traffic time penalties for different features of edge attributes in a graph.

  This function assigns traffic time penalties to edges.
  It considers various highway types, such as traffic signals, stop signs, turning circles, crossings, give-way signs, and mini roundabouts, and assigns corresponding time penalties to these features.

  Parameters
  ----------
  G : networkx.MultiGraph
      An undirected, unprojected graph with 'bearing' attributes on each edge.
  traffic_signals_time : int, optional
      The time penalty for passing through a traffic signal-controlled intersection (default: 30).
  stop_time : int, optional
      The time penalty for stopping at a stop sign or stop-controlled intersection (default: 15).
  turning_circle_time : int, optional
      The time penalty for navigating a turning circle or roundabout (default: 5).
  crossing_time : int, optional
      The time penalty for crossing a pedestrian crossing (default: 5).
  give_way_time : int, optional
      The time penalty for yielding at a give-way or yield sign (default: 5).
  mini_roundabout_time : int, optional
    The time penalty for navigating a mini roundabout (default: 5).

  Returns
  -------
  G : networkx.MultiGraph
      The graph with updated 'traffic_time' and 'total_time' attributes on each edge, representing the calculated traffic-related time penalties.

  Calculate turn penalties for different types of turns at intersections in a graph.

  This function computes turn penalties for various types of turns (left, right, U-turn) at intersections within a road network represented as a graph.

  Parameters
  ----------
  G : networkx.MultiDiGraph
      A directed graph representing a road network with 'bearing' attributes on each edge.
  left_turn_penalty : int, optional
